# Pentest-Nix
  
This is a start at creating a reproducible pentest environmoent via NixOS. This config is the the second nixos config I've done and the first time using flakes, so is likely a melting pot of different snippets containing bad practices etc.

## Usage

Ensure you have [NixOS](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Main_Page) with [Home Manager](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Home_Manager). For a VirtualBox VM make sure you're using the VMSVGA graphics adapter if you want auto-resizing and shared clipboard. 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/mister-turtle/pentest-nix
cd pentest-nix
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#nixos
```

## Notes
This repository is a work in progress, notably some of the following is missing:
- [ ] BurpSuite Professional
- [ ] Nessus Professional
- [ ] Sane NeoVim configs
- [ ] Sane TMUX configs
  
Tooling is currently being added but is fairly minimal for the moment.
